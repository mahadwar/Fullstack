<h3>WOW</h3>
      <p>
             A BIG political moment.

              For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement of intent from the new prime minister and new chancellor.
             <br><br>
              And it is a gamble.
             <br><br>
              A massive leap in a new direction.
             <br><br>
              It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour before that.
             <br><br>
              It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.
             <br><br>
              Economic growth is the prize they seek.
             <br><br>
              But they can't be certain their approach will work, nor the methods they have chosen to deliver it will be popular.
             <br><br>
              And then there are the side effects.
            <ul>
                  <li>At a glance: What's in the mini-budget?</li>
                  <li>What are the new stamp duty rates?</li>
                  <li>Will National Insurance changes leave me better off?</li>

            </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
            The markets are jittery. The value of the pound is slumping and the cost of government borrowing is rising, just when the government has said it going to borrow a shedload more money.
            <br><br>
            A few around here with a taste for political history have been making comparisons with the so-called 'Barber boom'.
            <br><br>
            A senior Labour figure was the first to mention it to me just as Kwasi Kwarteng prepared to get to his feet in the Commons.
            <br><br>
            And a few hours later, so did Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
            <br><br>
            The Barber boom is a reference to the stint in the Treasury of former Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber, when Ted Heath was prime minister.
            <br><br>
            Mr Barber cut taxes big time, particularly in 1972 - it being the only Budget in the last half century to cut taxes more than Kwasi Kwarteng just has.
            <br><br>
            Mr Barber wanted a "dash for growth". He borrowed money, cut taxes and the economy grew.
            <br><br>
            But strikes, unemployment and inflation followed, and the Conservatives lost the next general election.
            <br><br>
            Things are different now: unemployment is low, the Bank of England controls interest rates.
            <br><br>
           But don't be surprised if we hear more of Mr Barber's stewardship of the economy in the coming months, particularly from those sceptical about Mr Kwarteng's plans.
           <br><br>
           So, given the risks, and the historical precedent, why is the government choosing this approach?
           <br><br>
           They argue this is a calculated and worthwhile thing to do, because to do nothing, to maintain the status quo, would be a bigger gamble still.
           <br><br>
           And yes, growth has been sluggish for years and years, and the economy teeters on the edge of - or is perhaps already in - recession.
           <br><br>
           So few would dispute doing something to catalyse the economy, one way or another.
           <br><br>
           They do, though, have a big persuasion job on their hands, including, incidentally, among some on their own side.

             <ul>
                   <li>Kwarteng tax cuts reward the wealthy, Labour says</li>
                   <li>Kwarteng defends massive tax cuts as fair for all</li>
             </ul>
     </p>

     <p>
         There is a bunch of Conservative MPs who have never warmed to Liz Truss, and some who are hostile towards her political instincts.
         <br><br>
         One or two have already said as much publicly, others are keeping their thoughts to themselves for now.
         <br><br>
         Some fret the plan doesn't look fair, given the scale of the tax cuts for the richest.
         <br><br>
         Others see it as a sugar hit for the economy which runs the risk, they fear, of stoking inflation further.
         <br><br>
         For others though, in the parliamentary party and among the grassroots, this is a moment they can gladly cheer: what they see as a properly Conservative budget after all those years of coalition compromise, Brexit and Covid.
         <br><br>
         Which brings us to the coming political argument: the government hopes this set of measures will give the economy a giant injection of oomph.
         <br><br>
         It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are bold and stark.
